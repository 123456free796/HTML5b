# HTML5b
An HTML5 port of Cary Huang's flash game [BFDIA 5b](http://bfdi.tv/5b/) using only pureJS and HTML5.
Everything relating to the gameplay has been implemented and the current focus is now on adding the level editor.

A lot of the code in here I didn't write. Since actionscript is so similar to javascript; a lot of the code was just copy-pasted from the decompiled swf with some minor reformatting.
