# HTML5b
An HTML5 port of Cary Huang's "BFDIA 5b" flash game.
This port is not finished yet, but the vast majority of the gameplay elements have already been implemented, so it's just a matter of adding and optimising the rest of the visuals.

Also note: a lot of the code in here I didn't write. Since actionscript is so similar to javascript, a lot of the code was just copy-pasted from the decompiled swf.
