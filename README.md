# HTML5b
An HTML5 port of Cary Huang's flash game "BFDIA 5b".
Unless there's something I'm forgetting; everything relating to the gameplay has been implemented. The current focus is now on optimizing the existing code and working on adding the level editor.

Also note: a lot of the code in here I didn't write. Since actionscript is so similar to javascript; a lot of the code was just copy-pasted from the decompiled swf with some minor reformatting.
