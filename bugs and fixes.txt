this is a text file where I'm keeping track of things to fix/change.

fixes:
make the walking animations only restart when the player starts pressing or lets go of the key.
layer background blocks behind other blocks (and implement block depths in general)
you can still move when recovering
fix the fonts.
the music loops badly.

known bugs:
when jumping while running against a wall you can jump through deadly blocks without dying
stopCarrierY breaks sometimes
you can change your direction while dying
after switching characters, it can sometimes mess up the layering of some of carried objects.
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'vy')

the game crashes when a submerged object hits the bottom of the level
