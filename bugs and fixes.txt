this is a text file where I'm keeping track of things to fix/change.

fixes:
make the walking animations only restart when the player starts pressing or lets go of the key.
layer background blocks behind other blocks (and implement block depths in general)
fix the fonts.
the music loops badly.
you can change your direction while dying
after switching characters, it can sometimes mess up the layering of some of carried objects.

known bugs:
when jumping while running against a wall you can jump through deadly blocks without dying
