this is a text file where I'm keeping track of things to fix/change.

fixes:
make the walking animations only restart when the player starts pressing or lets go of the key.
layer background blocks behind other blocks (and implement block depths in general)
you can still move when recovering
fix the fonts.
the music loops badly.
the leg skewing is kinda broken.
dialog does not play after getting a win token

known bugs:
when jumping while running against a wall you can jump through deadly blocks without dying
stopCarrierY breaks sometimes
sometimes we get an error when we hit the edge (5b.js:3318:32)
you can change your direction while dying
after switching characters, it can sometimes mess up the layering of some of carried objects.
